<h1>Deadsets</h1>
NSS Ruby on Rails capstone project - NSS Cohort 2.

<h2>Purpose</h2>
Deadsets is a Ruby on Rails app which allows users to search for Grateful Dead concert setlists. If a user is signed in, they can save a concert to a list of favorites. It is my final project for Nashville Software School.

The goal is to provide a responsive, nice-looking app which will allow fans of Grateful Dead to research setlists and hopefully, spark conversation about Grateful Dead concerts with fellow fans of the band.

<h2>Project Status</h2>
These features are implemented and working:
- Setlist data scraped from http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~mleone/gdead/setlists.html
- Setlist search functionality implemented
- Devise user sign in/registration/sign out implemented
- Responsive CSS styling implemented
- Add concert to favorites for signed in user implemented

<h2>To-do</h2>
These features still need to be implemented:
- Access favorites for signed in user
- Delete favorites for signed in user


<h2>Features</h2>
- <strong>Search for a setlist</strong> - A concert date is entered, and the corresponding setlist data is populated on the page.
- <strong>Add concert to favorites</strong> - Once a concert setlist has been returned on page, if the user is signed in, they can save the corresponding concert date to a list of favorites for easy retrieval at a later date.
